 Don't you wish there was an easy way to get a summary of a really long, and even possibly boring video? This can be a movie that you are forced to watch for class, a speech made by someone important, or even just an audio recording of your pet.
  
  ## In this project I explored some more fascinating areas of machine learning (Speech-To-Text and NLP) and applied them to two different videos (Harry Potter, and The Boarded Window).
