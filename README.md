  ## Have you ever wished there was an easy way to get a summary of a really long, and even possibly boring video? This can be a movie that you are forced to watch for class, a speech made by someone important, or even just an audio recording of your pet. In this project you will learn exactly how to do that  
  
### In this project I explored some more fascinating areas of machine learning (Speech-To-Text and NLP) and applied them to two different videos (Harry Potter, and The Boarded Window). 
 
The file [Movie_Summarizer.ipynb](https://github.com/Shaier/Movie-Summarizer/blob/master/Movie_Summarizer.ipynb) explains my steps, along with some notes as usual.  
You can read about the project more on my [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/summarizing-harry-potter-with-ml-e724c024e2a2).
